This is a Ruby on Rails project for CS50.

The purpose is to implement a stock simulation game in Ruby on Rails.

Significant gratitude is owed to Michael Hartl and his e-book, Ruby on Rails Tutorial which helped
me tremendously with getting the basic website infrastructure set up and understanding how to use
Rails.
